# Algorithms for activity prediction

This repo contains results of evaluation two algithms, applied for purpose of activity prediction - `FP-Growth` and `PrefixSpan`.
These algorithms is evaluated in [Orange3 environment](https://github.com/biolab/orange3).

## Files

* `final.ows` - Orange 3 project file
* `*.py` - different code for `Python Script` widgets in the project
* `useful-activity.csv` - prepared dataset

## Usage

To correctly open the project two python modules should be installed:
* [orange3-associate](https://github.com/AlexTalker/orange3-associate)
* [orange3-prefixspan](https://github.com/AlexTalker/orange3-prefixspan)

Note that some changes were made upon original `orange3-associate` which may cause incorrect results if original module is used.

Documentation regarding usage of `Orange 3` can be found on [official site](https://orange.biolab.si/docs/).
